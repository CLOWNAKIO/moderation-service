        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <section>
            <p>Our service provides a wide range of services available for use via API (Application Programming Interface). This allows our customers to integrate our functions and data into their own applications and systems.</p>

            <p>In order to access our API services, you need to register on our website and confirm your details. Upon successful registration, you will be assigned a unique API TOKEN - a secret code that will be used each time you access our API.</p>

            <p>The API TOKEN is the key to our API services and is an essential element of authentication and security of the interaction between your application and our system. We recommend that you keep it secure and do not share it with third parties.</p>

            <p>Once you receive an API TOKEN, you will be able to use it to make various requests to our API. </p>

            <p>Our API provides a convenient and flexible way to integrate our services into your applications. We look forward to you joining our system, getting your TOKEN API and starting to use our service effectively via API.</p>
